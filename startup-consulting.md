    <h2 class="section-title">The Critical 0 to 1 Journey</h2>
    <p class="section-subtitle">As a seasoned engineering leader with <strong>15+ years building enterprise-scale systems</strong>, I help technology founders navigate the most critical phase of startup development. The journey from concept to product-market fit requires more than just coding‚Äîit demands <strong>strategic technical leadership, scalable architecture decisions, and startup-focused execution</strong>.</p>
    
    <p class="section-subtitle">Most startups fail not because of bad ideas, but because of <strong>poor technical execution and scaling decisions made early</strong>. My consulting approach combines deep technical expertise with startup strategy, ensuring your technology foundation supports rapid growth without technical debt that kills momentum.</p>
