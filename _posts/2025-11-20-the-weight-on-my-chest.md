I don’t usually share personal family history publicly, but I’ve reached a point where silence is no longer serving me. As the saying goes, *sunlight is the best disinfectant*, and I’ve spent most of my life keeping these realities in the dark — largely to protect people who have never protected me in the ways that actually mattered.

This post isn’t written out of anger.
It’s written out of clarity, closure, and the recognition that my silence has allowed a false narrative to take root among people who don’t know the truth.

This is my final word on the subject.

For anyone reading this who doesn’t know me or my family, here is the context:

I grew up with a father whose approach to parenting was authoritarian and punitive, and a mother whose behavior fit the patterns of covert narcissism — her emotional needs, her ego, and her self-image always taking priority over the actual needs of her children. While my parents provided for us in material ways, they never protected us emotionally or psychologically. They never taught us emotional maturity or how to co-regulate, because they themselves were emotionally underdeveloped.

Some people wonder why adult children go no-contact. The truth is simple:
**If any of this had been limited to my childhood, I might still have a relationship with them today.**
But these patterns did not stay in childhood. They continued — unchanged, unexamined, and unacknowledged — into my adult life.

For over a decade, my brother and I named these dynamics explicitly and asked for help, honesty, and accountability. What follows is a structured list of concrete examples illustrating the ongoing pattern:

---

### **1. Chronic neglect around basic care**

* Starting in sixth grade, I was routinely the last kid picked up from school — often waiting *hours* after everyone else — because being there for me simply wasn’t a priority.

### **2. Emotional abandonment during formative trauma**

* When the girl I lost my virginity to began sleeping with someone else, I was devastated. My parents didn’t comfort me or help me regulate; they simply sent me to stay with my brother because they lacked the interest and emotional skill to support me during one of the most defining experiences of adolescence.

### **3. Punitive cruelty instead of curiosity or care**

* When I was caught smoking pot behind the gym, my parents sent my brother to *abuse me* as punishment instead of asking what pain or confusion might be driving my behavior.
* They also barred me from attending the funeral of a classmate who had died by suicide, denying me community and closure.

### **4. Boundary violations and disrespect in adulthood**

* During an attempted reconciliation years later, my father made offensive remarks about my wife and her partner.
* He was then observed looking at pornography on his phone while sitting on my couch in a shared space — an act of profound disrespect and a complete boundary collapse.

### **5. Reacting to accountability with defensiveness and victimhood**

* When I called my mother out for posting racist content on Facebook, she framed it as *me victimizing her* by naming the behavior.
* This was the primary catalyst for her disengagement from me and my eventual disinheritance.

### **6. A complete lack of empathy during my financial crisis**

* After I was laid off in October 2023 and at risk of losing my home, they offered no emotional support and made jokes about the possibility of me losing my house.

### **7. The ongoing protection of my mother’s ego above all else**

* When I accurately described the narcissistic abuse cycle, my father attacked me in order to protect her ego, maintaining the same dysfunctional dynamic at the cost of honesty and relationship.

### **8. Weaponizing misinterpretation to avoid accountability**

* My brother was diagnosed by a therapist with *emotional incest syndrome*, a term referring to enmeshment and inappropriate emotional boundaries — not sexual behavior.
* My mother then spent the next decade telling people he accused her of sexual misconduct, either because she refuses to understand the term or because rejecting an accusation she knows is false is easier than confronting the one that is true.

### **9. A revealing moment about her worldview**

* In front of my wife and me, my mother said she regretted adopting my disabled sister — a person I love deeply — exposing how conditional, transactional, and ego-driven her idea of “care” has always been.

### **10. Treating accountability as persecution**

* Any time my brother or I asked for accountability, honesty, or reflection, my mother reframed it as cruelty.
* In her worldview, accountability equals attack, boundaries equal betrayal, and honesty equals emotional violence — making genuine relationship impossible.

### **11. Using therapy as justification for further disengagement**

* While my mother did attend therapy at one point, she used it not for growth but as a way to further insulate herself from accountability.
* The therapist she saw helped her frame the entire situation around protecting herself, with no regard for the impact of her behavior on her children.
* Therapy became a tool for self-justification rather than healing — allowing her to fully disengage from us without ever examining the harm or the underlying patterns.

These are not isolated incidents.
They are the pattern — a pattern spanning decades.

And so I want to be clear:

**The reason I’m posting this — and the reason I have no intention of deleting it — is because I am no longer willing to let my silence be the platform on which others construct their narrative. My silence has protected them at the cost of my own truth for far too long.**

This is my record.
This is my truth.
This is my closure.
This is the last thing I will ever say on the subject.
