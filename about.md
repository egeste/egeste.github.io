I've <strong>co-founded technology companies</strong>, built platforms that process millions of data points, and developed specialized solutions for problems that don't have off-the-shelf answers.<br><br>While most developers build the same apps over and over, I focus on <strong>unique technical challenges</strong>: OSINT intelligence platforms, advanced security testing, rapid prototyping for complex domains, and automation for processes others say can't be automated.<br><br>Currently at <strong>Delphos Labs</strong> leading binary analysis with AI, I bring a combination of startup grit, technical depth, and the ability to see solutions where others see impossible problems."
