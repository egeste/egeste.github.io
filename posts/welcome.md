Welcome to the new Egeste.NET
=============================

The [CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sinzone) and [CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcopalladino) of Mashape once joked that my blog for looked like "something out of the 90's". I disagree, but in any case it was time for a new site. I figured I should probably just roll my own for funsies. You're looking at it.

Technology
----------
This blog uses [Oraculum](https://hackers.lookout.com/oraculum) for structure, [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for rendering markdown, and the [github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) as a source of truth for posts/pages, etc. It is loosely based on iTerm2, my go-to for finger wiggling.
